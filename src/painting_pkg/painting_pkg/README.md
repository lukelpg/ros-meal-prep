### Stroke Requests

Line request:
    "line, 0, 0, -500, -500, 100"

    Means:
        Stroke Type: "line"
        Start Coordinate: (0, 0)
        End Coordinate: (-500, -500)
        Depth: 100

    The system will generate evenly spaced points along that line.

Arc request:
    "arc, -500, -500, 200, 0, 90, 200"

    Means:
        Stroke Type: "arc"
        Center: (-500, -500)
        Radius: 200
        Start Angle: 0째
        End Angle: 180째
        Depth: 200

    The system will generate points along an arc from 0째 to 90째.
